This wrapper includes three parts:\n\nInstallation and direct access to FEniCS via a Conda installation. Alternatively, one may use their current FEniCS installation.\nA low-level development API and provides some functionality to make directly dealing with the library a little bit easier, but still requires knowledge of FEniCS itself. Interfaces have been provided for the main functions and their attributes, and instructions to add further ones can be found here.\nA high-level API for usage with DifferentialEquations. An example can be seen solving the heat equation with high order adaptive timestepping.\n\nVarious gists/jupyter notebooks have been created to provide a brief overview of the overall functionality, and of any differences between the Pythonic FEniCS and the Julian wrapper. DifferentialEquations.jl ecosystem. Paraview can also be used to visualize various results, just like in FEniCS (see below).","category":"section"},{"location":"#Installation-Instructions","page":"FEniCS.jl: Finite Element PDE Solving in Julia","title":"Installation Instructions","text":"To get the wrapper on your system, providing a FEniCS installation exists, follow the below steps:\n\nAdd PyCall with the correct Python environment corresponding to FEniCS. Then simply add FEniCS.jl using Pkg.add(\"FEniCS\")\nAlternatively, one can install Docker and then run the following command\n\ndocker run -ti cmhyett/julia-fenics\n\nand once inside, Julia can be accessed by calling\n\njulia\n\nOnce inside the Julia environment, simply add FEniCS with Pkg.add(\"FEniCS\"). All other dependencies are handled by the docker image.\n\nThis wrapper was originally started via the Google Summer of Code program along with the help of Chris Rackauckas and Bart Janssens. This was continued via GSoC '18 along with the help of Chris Rackauckas and Timo Betcke.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Tutorial","page":"FEniCS.jl: Finite Element PDE Solving in Julia","title":"Tutorial","text":"Below is a small demonstration of how a user would use our code to solve the Poisson equation with Dirichlet conditions.
